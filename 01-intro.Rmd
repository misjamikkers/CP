## Course objectives
This course pursues two content goals. First, to get students acquainted with the history, objectives, institutional set-up, and practice of (European) competition policy and economic regulation. Second, to equip students with some of the specific economic theories and tools needed to analyze competition policy and regulatory cases.
A key intermediate objective is for students to obtain hands-on experience with real competition policy cases.
At the end of the course, students should be able to analyze a real or fictitious competition policy or regulatory case, identify (potential) competition and regulation problems, and recommend an appropriate course of action based on economic evidence the way a case handler at a competition or regulatory authority would if asked to review the case.
