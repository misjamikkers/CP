\section{Course objectives}\label{course-objectives}

This course pursues two content goals. First, to get students acquainted
with the history, objectives, institutional set-up, and practice of
(European) competition policy and economic regulation. Second, to equip
students with some of the specific economic theories and tools needed to
analyze competition policy and regulatory cases. A key intermediate
objective is for students to obtain hands-on experience with real
competition policy cases. At the end of the course, students should be
able to analyze a real or fictitious competition policy or regulatory
case, identify (potential) competition and regulation problems, and
recommend an appropriate course of action based on economic evidence the
way a case handler at a competition or regulatory authority would if
asked to review the case.

\section{Problems}\label{problems}

The idea with these lectures is that students in teams will present
solutions to policy makers for some competition and regulation problems.
The students will present the case in class to the government.

the presentation (20 mins) should:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  describe the problem
\item
  discuss the relevant academic literature
\item
  present policy options (including pro's and cons from an economic
  perspective)
\end{itemize}

\item
  teams I, J, K, L
\end{itemize}

\section{Cases}\label{cases}

In the cases students will form new teams. Some teams will represent the
government (Comptetition Authority or Regulator), the other teams will
represent the firms. We will provide some data, so the teams can also do
a quantative analysis.

The students not assigned to a team will form the jury and will have to
formulate a verdict.

  \chapter{Firms: teams 7 and 8}\label{firms-teams-7-and-8}

  Finally, we urge you to use google (or other search engines like
  DuckDuckGo) and stackoverflow with your assignments. Some students
  find this weird at the beginning: should we not teach you everything
  that you need to know? The answer is no for a number of reasons.
  First, even professional programmers use google and stackoverflow all
  the time. If you are on Quora; see this post and this one. Second,
  python and R are open source and lots of people work with it. If you
  encounter a problem, chances are that someone else had the same
  problem and knows the solution to it. There is not need to ``invent
  the wheel''. Use the resources available to you. If you copy a lot of
  code, you should add a reference. Finally, because python and R are
  open source, they develop rapidly. The things that we teach you now,
  will be obsolete in a couple of years time. Hence, you need to be able
  to find your way around also in 10 years time. To start practicing
  this, use google now.

\end{enumerate}

The only warning here is: at the exam you will not have access to the
whole internet. So, also make sure that you can find help in the jupyter
notebook. We will practice this in class.
