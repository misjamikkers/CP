The review of economic studies, Vol 83, Issue 3, 1156-1188., https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/83/3/1156/2461273 3.13 Problems The idea with these lectures is that students in teams will present solutions to policy makers for some competition and regulation problems. The students will present the case in class to the government. the presentation (20 mins) should: describe the problem discuss the relevant academic literature present policy options (including pro’s and cons from an economic perspective) 3.14 Lecture 14 Transparancy of prices in the hospital market 20-03 (MM) Teams A, B, C, D 3.15 Lecture 15 Competition problem number 2 25-03 (MA) teams E, F, G, H 3.16 Lecture 16 Regulation problem 27-03 (MM) teams I, J, K, L 3.17 Cases In the cases students will form new teams. Some teams will represent the government (Comptetition Authority or Regulator), the other teams will represent the firms. We will provide some data, so the teams can also do a quantative analysis. The students not assigned to a team will form the jury and will have to formulate a verdict. 3.18 Lecture 17 Competition case 01-04 (MA) Competition Authority: teams 1 and 2 Firms: teams 3 and 4 3.19 Lecture 18 Regulation case 03-04 (MM) Note: Nursing homes Regulator: teams 5 and 6 3.19 Firms: teams 7 and 8 Finally, we urge you to use google (or other search engines like DuckDuckGo) and stackoverflow with your assignments. Some students find this weird at the beginning: should we not teach you everything that you need to know? The answer is no for a number of reasons. First, even professional programmers use google and stackoverflow all the time. If you are on Quora; see this post and this one. Second, python and R are open source and lots of people work with it. If you encounter a problem, chances are that someone else had the same problem and knows the solution to it. There is not need to “invent the wheel”. Use the resources available to you. If you copy a lot of code, you should add a reference. Finally, because python and R are open source, they develop rapidly. The things that we teach you now, will be obsolete in a couple of years time. Hence, you need to be able to find your way around also in 10 years time. To start practicing this, use google now. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 54edd162eaf857e745bc2b1bfdd68064d89af608 The only warning here is: at the exam you will not have access to the whole internet. So, also make sure that you can find help in the jupyter notebook. We will practice this in class. "],

In 2019-2020 this course is taught by: Santiago Bohorquez Jose Carreno Bustos Misja Mikkers Marius-Lucian Prisacuta Florian Sniekers Jierui Yang. 5.3.2 How do we teach this course? online lectures on Datacamp tutorials: with plenty of time to ask questions there are a number of “regular” tutorials and one in the computer lab if you do not have a laptop, attend the tutorial in the computer lab if you do have a laptop, attend your regular tutorial group no need to attend both! we may drop some tutorial groups, so check Canvas! schedule can be found in the chapter schedule on this website we can track your progress on datacamp assignment notebooks to be made before the class class notebooks that we do together in class (to allow you to ask questions) 5.3.3 Information about the course all information about the course can be found on this website pay attention to: -the schedule: explaining when you need to do what -the rules for the exam explaining how the exam works and a practice exam Your grade -There are two separate ways to earn your grade regular route: -midterm on python -end of semester exam on R resit -exam on python and R combined -you cannot use grades from one route for the other one. 5.3.4 Exam for more information see the exam chapter check the instructions for the exam do not open your exam file after you have finished if you do, your exam will not be graded (even if you did not change anything) at the exam you can freely copy and paste from the assignments we did in class we will not post answers to the assignments make sure you attend the tutorials and pay attention in class! 5.3.5 Datacamp you need to sign up for Datacamp! for details see the chapter Important note the deadline for filling in the webform! if you miss the deadline, you may have to pay for premium content on Datacamp yourself 5.3.6 markdown syntax markdown allows you to create structure in a simple way examples are: # this is a heading ## subheading * first bullet * second bullet [link text](actual link, e.g. http://www.etc) ![Alt text for image](/path/to/img.jpg &quot;Optional title&quot;) look on the web for other syntax like footnotes etc. equations you can type in latex latex is great word processing software for now, we only need it to write math you can guess what the following will do: $x^2$, $\\beta$, $\\sqrt{9}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\bar x$ \\begin{equation} a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\end{equation} if you need something, just google; e.g. “google latex phi” or “google latex empty set” etc. and try it out in the jupyter notebook 5.4 Second part of lecture: making sure you get the course material and a grade for this course go to the server and start a jupyter notebook link to the server address to copy/paste in the google form importing the course material, see chapter Schedule (this is also the way you will import your exam) evaluating cells you can choose python/R kernel getting help: ? and TAB code vs. markdown cell type some latex 5.4.1 before you leave do the steps under the chapter Important "],
["exam-1.html", "Chapter 6 Exam 6.1 Grade 6.2 Useful to know 6.3 Exam procedure", " Chapter 6 Exam 6.1 Grade Your grade is either determined by: the midterm exam which is python only (50%) the exam will be R only (50%) or by the resit which is based on both python and R (100%) Each exam lasts 3 hours. You cannot combine the resit with the midterm etc. 6.2 Useful to know The questions that we ask in the exam are based on the notebooks that we discuss in class. Hence make sure that you have these ready before the exam. You are allowed to use copy-paste out of these notebooks. During the semester, you can use google to find information on functions, error messages etc. However, during the exam you can only access a limited number of pages. In particular, during the exam you work in a special exam environment on TiU computers. We have asked IT to whitelist the following websites: the russet server (where you will do your exam) gitlab (where you will import your exam from) Canvas (where we will give you the command to import the exam) stackoverflow python.org numpy scipy pandas datacamp cookbook tidyverse.org rpubs rstudio r4ds rdocumentation 6.3 Exam procedure we will post the exam both on gitlab. You will get instructions how to get the exam on the Russet server. finishing your exam make sure that we can easily see which notebook is your exam that is, do not rename the exam notebook (so that we do not know which notebook it is) do not have 5 different versions of the exam notebook; we will then choose one at random and grade this one after you finish the exam, do not re-open the notebook again: we can see the last time the notebook was opened. If this is after you left the exam room, we can see this and will nullify your exam. "],
