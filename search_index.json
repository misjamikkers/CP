First, to get students acquainted with the history, objectives, institutional set-up, and practice of (European) competition policy and economic regulation. Second, to equip students with some of the specific economic theories and tools needed to analyze competition policy and regulatory cases. A key intermediate objective is for students to obtain hands-on experience with real competition policy cases. At the end of the course, students should be able to analyze a real or fictitious competition policy or regulatory case, identify (potential) competition and regulation problems, and recommend an appropriate course of action based on economic evidence the way a case handler at a competition or regulatory authority would if asked to review the case. 2.3 Practical information Language of instruction: English We will use Python and/or R for data analysis Type of instruction: interactive lectures Credits: 6 ECTS Course website: Canvas "],

The students will present the case in class to the government. the presentation (20 mins) should: describe the problem discuss the relevant academic literature present policy options (including pro’s and cons from an economic perspective) 3.15 Lecture 14 Transparancy of prices in the hospital market 22-03 (MM) Teams A, B, C, D 3.16 Lecture 15 Competition problem number 2 27-03 (MA) teams E, F, G, H 3.17 Lecture 16 Regulation problem 29-03 (MM) teams I, J, K, L 3.18 Cases In the cases students will form new teams. Some teams will represent the government (Comptetition Authority or Regulator), the other teams will represent the firms. We will provide some data, so the teams can also do a quantative analysis. The students not assigned to a team will form the jury and will have to formulate a verdict. 3.19 Lecture 17 Competition case 03-04 (MA) Competition Authority: teams 1 and 2 Firms: teams 3 and 4 3.20 Lecture 18 Regulation case 05-04 (MM) Note: Nursing homes Regulator: teams 5 and 6 Firms: teams 7 and 8 "],
